                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>At EXPNS, we believe managing money shouldn’t be complicated. 
                        That’s why we built a simple, intuitive tool to help you track your expenses, 
                        set budgets, and understand where your money goes. Our mission is to empower 
                        individuals to make smarter financial decisions by giving them clarity and 
                        control over their spending. Driven by passion and powered by technology, EXPNS
                        is designed for anyone who wants to take charge of their finances—whether you’re 
                        saving for the future, cutting unnecessary costs, or just curious about your habits.
                        Because at the end of the day, it’s not just about tracking numbers—it’s about building
                        better habits, reaching your goals, and spending wiser.
